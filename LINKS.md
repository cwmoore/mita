# Links
### Some first links
1. GitHub
    * This following is a friendly introduction to GitHub in a conversational tone.
    * [What is this “GitHub” of which you all speak?](https://code.likeagirl.io/what-is-this-github-of-which-you-all-speak-85de7de36cdf) (Beginning)
    * [Starting@GitHub](https://github.com/cwmoore/hello-world/blob/master/LINKS.md)
2. Markdown
    * [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) (how I made this page)
2. Coding
    * Just starting? The rest of this page is not what you need. I'm still organizing my thoughts about where to go next with MITA. [more]
    * [Coding Maxims](https://gist.github.com/lyoshenka/0a43205aa9a072b196ff87e2c689a8b9)

1. Code Modeling
    * [UML - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_tool)
    * [Java-to-UML Tool](https://github.com/shubhamvadhera/uml-parser) (neat hack? or something else?)

[more]: The thought that's bouncing around in my skull is *just how cool it would be* if I could pull up an interesting repository from GitHub and play the `git log` output from the beginning to the current state, by cycling through "diffs in place" in the editor, or through generated UML diagrams, as they evolved over the course of development/many commits.

I can promise a certain number of minimum hours to the App Team's projects, and I am here to learn and explore.
